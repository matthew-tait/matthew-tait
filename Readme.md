Is anybody out there?

Broadly I am interested in modelling problem spaces rather than solution spaces.

I am fascinated by computational reasoning and busy researching(privately)/learning about various methods and techniques relating to Inductive Logic Programming,
Statistical Relational Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Knowledge Bases/graphs. 

I wouldn't say I am necessarily technically skilled in this area but I do have a huge amount of passion and drive. I am currently trying to figure out how
to peice together a framework or methodology to allow computational agents to reason around restricted technical domains.

I love application as well as theory and would love to find a way to 
connect with people who like to think/talk about these sort of things. I have realised the need for connections and collaboration. 

I am hoping to find someone or a group of people who would be interested in researching/implementing/commercialising ideas related to this area. I have some 
initial use cases to orientate around initially. 

I'll commit things here and there as they come up but I am in the very early stages which largely consists of pen and paper notebooks and just beginning to try and 
produce a formal system that uses rudimentary reasoning patterns to reason within toy problem domains.

If these sort of problems give you wild eyes and make your heart race with excitement please reach out on 
computationreasoning@gmail.com

I am especially interested to hear from people who communicate in the form of Haiku (albeit poorly written!).

With the lull into Autumn;

Dreams do softly glow;
